<p style="color:khaki;text-align:center;"> Hello! My name is Maliha. I am a high school student from New York City. 
  I was born on October 10, 2000 in New York. I am not sure of my future plans, but I am willing to explore my interests. 
  As of now, my interests are diversified, but primarily within computer science and music. 
  I am infamous for my clumsiness, but it adds to my charm (I hope). 
  I am usually a very quiet person but strive to be more open and loud. 
  I hope you enjoy your visit to this website dedicated to me (this feels so weird help me). </p>

<button type="button" onclick="document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = '<p style="color:khaki;"> 7/25/17 - Coding makes my brain hurt.\
I can't wait until I get to go to Detroit on Thursday. I like music a lot. My brain feels very happy thinking about music.</p>\
7/19/17 - Python is really hard to code in.\
So far we've been using Scratch to code, and Scratch is straightforward because it is so visual.\
You see blocks stacked above or under each other and in that way, you can understand sequences and how everything comes together.\
While Python can do the same stuff Scratch can, it's harder because you have to write it yourself.\
In Scratch, changing the colors of each side on shapes on my shape drawer was simple, but I couldn't figure that out for Python.\
My program bugged often on Python because I wasn't sure on how to use a "for" loop, so my defined function was not working.\
It was frustrating dealing with these errors especially because I know so little about Python as of now.\
In the end, I could not reach the end result I wanted but I am still somewhat satisfied with what I achieved and I came out of this experience knowing much more than I did before.\
I liked seeing what my coded program produced but the work it took to get there was long and tedious.\
My brain really hurts.</p>'">Button</button>
